# Introduction 
Introducing A brand new programming language : **Hindi4All**.

Not so familiar to English and finding trouble in learning and understanding programming concepts due to difficult nomenclature(naming) of concepts no issues. 

We have our language in simple hindi so new developers need not get into remembering those difficult words , you can focus on more logical and concepts like backtracking algorithms ,Dynamic Programming {later these too would get simplified so do not worry}

# Note:
The site and CLI is currently unavailable accounting to the end of hosting plan. The project will be available via a link as well as a Docker image as soon as possible.
# Features
The language has all features of a traditional programming language starting form looping, standard String and Math methord’s to OOP concepts like classes, inheritance and concepts like threads and processes, file handling, networking, user defined data structures including traditional data-structures like trees, graphs and much more.{The language is very similar to java so if you know java shifting would be very easy,Also the currently supported topics are available at its documentation others are yet to be added as of now .}

# Site
The  documentation of the language live is available at 
[docs](https://prathameshbhagat.000webhostapp.com/docs/docs)

# Additional Features 
Already got familiar with a traditional programming language, no worries ,specific files would be available at the official site for respective languages using which you would be able to embed the code directly and you would be able to shift between your traditional programming language and our language with ease. 

Currently the online web-based compiler in [here](https://crptrest.000webhostapp.com/) supports our language and java so you can embed java anywhere and our language.{As now it has issues of wrong cursor position as it uses opensource web editor ace editor,you will face issues if you try to change cursor position , very soon the problem would be fixed.}

E.g. `int a=0;अंक अ =0;` would work completely fine `int` belongs to java and `अंक` to our language.

Also the language uses a refrence compiler so the refrenced compiler's language features would be natively supported.


Soon .jar file would be provided through which you would be able to add code of our language in your java projects easily and support of other languages like Python ,C ,C# would be provided later.
